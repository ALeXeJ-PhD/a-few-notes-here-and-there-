# a-few-notes-here-and-there-
some plausible directions / sets 


my work on github is a mix of workable code (mostly in python) and esoteric and arcane (often skeletons of project ideas) notes in mathematics and computational linguistics 
previously I worked for ScaleAI and as a contractor for OpenAI on GPT-3 iterations daVinci, GPT3, GPT3.5, InstructGPT, and ChatGPT and others 


if you borrow anything from me or use it just please acknowledge me 

peace and love to you, 

alexej

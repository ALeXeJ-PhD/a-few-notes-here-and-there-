# a-few-notes-here-and-there-
some plausible directions / sets 


my work on github is a mix of workable code (mostly in python) and esoteric and arcane (often skeletons of project ideas) notes in mathematics and computational linguistics 
previously I worked for ScaleAI and as a contractor for OpenAI on GPT-3 iterations daVinci and others in predictive analytics, neural networks, and things of that nature 


not here to show off, just keeping it real 

if you borrow anything from me or use it just please ackknowledge me politely, knowledge is cool

peace and love to you, 

alexej
